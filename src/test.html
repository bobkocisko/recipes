Fluffy Blueberry/Chocolate Chip Pancakes
----------------------------------------

3 eggs
1/2 cup full-fat coconut milk
3 tablespoons full-fat coconut milk
1 tablespoon organic honey
1/2 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup coconut flour
1/2 cup tapioca flour
1/2 teaspoon + 1/8 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
Pinch of fine-grain sea salt
Coconut oil, for greasing the skillet
1/2 cup fresh blueberries or chocolate chips
Coconut Butter, for serving
Maple syrup, for garnish


Instructions
------------

1. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs.

2. To the eggs add the coconut milk, honey, lemon juice, and vanilla and whisk until well blended.

3. In a separate bowl, mix together the coconut flour and tapioca flour, then add to the wet ingredients 1/4 cup (60 grams) at a time, while continuously whisking.

4. Then mix in the baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

5. Grease a large skillet and place over medium heat.

6. Once the skillet is hot, use a ladle to pour 3-inch (7.5-cm) pancakes in the skillet.

7. Once holes begin to appear in the surface of a pancake, drop a small handful of chocolate chips onto it and flip it. The pancake should cook on each side for 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with rest of the batter.

8. Top with coconut butter and enjoy!
